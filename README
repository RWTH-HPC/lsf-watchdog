lsf_watchdog is an application, which watches for all currently submitted
jobs in LSF, determine all relevant information and passes it to check-
scripts, which are stored in a directory.

Each check-script can handle some checks, but it is recommended, to
implement only one check per file. If any check exits with an non-zero
exit-code, the check will be marked as failed.

At the end, a list of all failed checks is printed out for the local user
so he can look, whats up with this jobs.
Array-Jobs will not be handled twice, If any check was checked before, it
will be marked as checked and will no longer be checked for submission-
checks, but instead checks for the running environment will be done.
